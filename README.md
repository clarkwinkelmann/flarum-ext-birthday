A [Flarum](https://flarum.org/) extension. Birthday setting for users.

This is a demo extension. It's not published on Packagist so you can't install it.

Fell free to fork into your own extension !

Note: dist files were omitted from GitHub. Run `yarn install` and `yarn build` in the `js` folder to create them before installing this extension locally.
If you fork, remove the last two lines in `.gitignore` so that the dist and lock files get commited.
